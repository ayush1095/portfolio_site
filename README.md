# Portfolio_site

# Udacity
Front end Developer programme.



# Bootstrap
This site is made using Bootstrap, which made this  a **responsive** , mobile first **fluid grid system** that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. Predefined classes helped make easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

Bootstrap, easily and efficiently scales this website with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries.
